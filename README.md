# MyMVVMProject
 Vue+SpringBoot+MySQL
This project is my learning project, three parts included: Vue Project„ÄÅSpringBoot Project and SQL Scripts. My Vue Project is created by vue-cli. Using Element UI makes it easier to optimize its interface and Router is in charge of interface skip. To send http requests and receive responses, I included the module of Axios, which encapsulates Ajax, achieving asynchronous communication. I wrote the project code in IDEA, which has a comfortable gui interface to start the server. My SpringBoot Project is created by IDEA. It expose ports to exchange data with Vue Project, send sql messages to MySQL database and processes data from database. My database is MySQL 8.0, and I use MySQL WorkBench 8.0 CE to manage my database visually.
